# How to get up and running

1. Create a file called `WIFI_CONFIG.py`
2. Add your wifi SSID (network name) and Password to this file, following the structure in `WIFI_CONFIG.py.example`
3. Plug in your Raspberry Pi Pico (or other compatible board)
4. Download the [MicroPico VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) then use the `MicroPico: Upload current file to Pico`.
   (If you have Thonny, you can use that to do this step too)

All set! You should be able to connect to WIFI now!
